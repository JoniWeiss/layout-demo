        Do you want a jelly baby? Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. Life depends on change and renewal. My ship…my <span class="child">TARDIS</span>… Oh my word! Dreams are important…never underestimate them. I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Would you like a jelly baby? Goodbye... Fancypants! I don't like it. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.
